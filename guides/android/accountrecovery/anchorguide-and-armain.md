# Account Recovery in Anchor - Android

## Step 1 - Add Account

It is highly recommended that after you create an account you go through the account recovery process.  This accomplishes two things:
- Verifies that your owner key certificate is valid
- Walks you through the process, so you know how to useit

To begin the account import process, select <span style="color:green">**Add Account**</span>.

## Step 2 - Recover Account

In this walkthrough, we’re going to be covering Account Recovery specifically.  While importing is a valid way to recover an account, it is a different process that we’ll go over later 

For more information on Account Import, see here.

## Step 3 - Scan QR Code

At this point, you’ll be presented with a viewfinder window for your device’s camera.  You’ll use this to scan the QR code on your Owner Key Certificate.

Once the QR code is read, the screen will advance automatically.

## Step 4 - Enter 6 Words

In order to advance further, you will need to enter the 6 words that were provided to you when you backed up your account and were given the Owner Key Certificate.

Make sure you sure you spell the words correctly and enter them in the correct order. Once you add the 6th word, the screen will again advance automatically.

## Step 5 - Add or Reset Keys

Upon successful entry of the 6 word phrase, you’ll come to this screen, where you can select whether to add another key to your account or reset all the keys to your account
- Adding a key will maintain access via whatever device you initially created the account with
- Resetting the keys will make it so only this current device can access this account

Making a selection will advance to the next screen
